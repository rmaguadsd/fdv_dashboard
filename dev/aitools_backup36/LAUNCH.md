# FDV Apps Launcher

Use this to start both FDV apps (Report v2 and POLL) with one command.

## Options
- Report v2 runs on port 5057.

- Ports already in use are skipped.
- Uses the workspace virtual environment at `dev/.venv` if present.

## Run from VS Code Task

```

or using the wrapper script:

& "c:/Users/rmaguad/OneDrive - NANDPS/Documents/Work_mirror/dev/aitools/launch_fdv_apps.ps1"
```
