FDV and CHAR File Guides:
- FDV input files has the following filename convention:
        Output_<site number>_<time stamp>_charrun_<some information about this run>_tb_set_utility_<fdvlistname>
  
- FDV (jsut FDV) log format of the following tokens:
    1a. For functional data or FDV type of log:
        <FDV OUTPUT>,<FDV path>/<FDV filename or fdvtest or fdvtest or test module or just module>.FDV::<tname>,<a series of comma separated test conditions>,<DUT number>,<pass/fail testresult>,<number of bytes>,<number of failing bytes>,<rate of failing bytes or byber>,<number of failing bits>,<rate of fail bits or rber>,<rber limit>,<failing data>
        Example:
        FDV OUTPUT [D:\NAND\150S\FDV\STAGING\RMAGUAD/BASIC_ERASE_PROGRAM_PAGE_READ_EIMPRO/BASIC_PROGRAM_PAGE_READ_EIMPRO_QLC.FDV::READ_ECC_BLK_778_PG_37_PGTYPE_LP_WL_2_SB_1_BL_3,SSYNC=TRUE,TRC=,DUTTEMP=-999,TAC=5.725000,SPECOFFSET=0.125,TM=12,VCC=2.5,VCCQ=1.2,TEMP=25]: DUT1,PASS,18592,16,0.00086,16,0.00011,0.008,FAILCOUNT_ONLY,

        FDV path = D:\NAND\150S\FDV\STAGING\RMAGUAD/BASIC_ERASE_PROGRAM_PAGE_READ_EIMPRO
        FDV filename or fdvtest = BASIC_PROGRAM_PAGE_READ_EIMPRO_QLC.FDV
        FDV tname = READ_ECC_BLK_778_PG_37_PGTYPE_LP_WL_2_SB_1_BL_3
        FDV test conditions = SSYNC=TRUE,TRC=,DUTTEMP=-999,TAC=5.725000,SPECOFFSET=0.125,TM=12,VCC=2.5,VCCQ=1.2,TEMP=25
        DUT = DUT1

    2a. Below is an example of an FDV log file:
        Output_site111_8_15_2025_22_58_06_fdvrun_pr19_25_vloop_tmloop_14_tb_set_utility_MRR_MLBI_READ.txt

        The logfile consist of the following tokens:
        Output_<site number>_<time stamp>_fdvrun_<some information about this run>_tb_set_utility_<fdvlistname>

    3a. Generate a master csv file based on log file.
        The CSV must contain the fields specified in "FDV master csv fields" below. If the value of token is not available, treat it as a wildcard

- CHAR or FDV POLL log format of the following tokens:
    1a. For char data or FDV POLL or array char
        <FDV POLL>,<FDV path>/<FDV filename or arraychar or test module or just module>.FDV::<tname>,<a series of comma separated test conditions>,<DUT number> 0,<poll measurement or char data; ignore if data is -999>,<ignore everyting after char data>
        Example:
        FDV POLL [D:\NAND\150S\FDV\STAGING\RMAGUAD/char/array_char>/<TR_SSLC>.FDV::<POLL_TR_C0_SP_READ_BLK_364_PG_82_PGTYPE_SSLC_WL_4_SB_10_BL_1,SSYNC=FALSE,TRC=,DUTTEMP=-999,TAC=6.300000,SPECOFFSET=0,TM=12,VCC=2.5,VCCQ=1.2,TEMP=25]: DUT1 0,33.205807,39839,[Per = 3334.000000/4000000.000000, nTECCount: 39839.000000]
          In this example:
              fdv filename = TR_SSLC.FDV
              POLL = indicating polling for a status signal  
              TR = specname
              C0 = status token (other possible values are: E0, F0, E4, etc)
              SP = plane operation (other possible value is MP, 2P, 3P, 4P, 5P, 6P)
              BLK_363 = blk 364
              PG_82 = page 82.
              PGTYPE_SSLC = pagetype SSLC (other possible values are DSLC, QLC, TLC, MLC, etc)
              WL_4 = wordline 4
              SB_10 = sub block 10
              BL_1 = bitline 1
              [comma separated test conditions]
              DUT1 = DUT# this is associated with a corresponding FUSEID
              0 = ignore this token
              33.205807 = this is measurement or data for this line
              [ignore the rest of the line]


    2a. Below is an example of an CHAR log file name:
        Output_site111_8_15_2025_22_58_06_fdvrun_pr19_25_vloop_tmloop_14_tb_set_utility_MRR_MLBI_READ.txt

        The logfile consist of the following tokens:
        Output_<site number>_<time stamp>_charrun_<some information about this run>_tb_set_utility_<fdvlistname>

FDV master csv fields
    product type or pagemap: if tname or fdvtest name contains any of these fields - MLC, QLC, TLC, SSLC, DSLC - it will be the value to take as pagemap
    status: C0, E0, 80, E1, F0
    plane::op or plane operation or plane-op or plane-ops or plane_op: SP, MP (for single plane and multi-plane, respectively)
    BLOCK address or BLK information, format is BLK_<Number> or BLK:<Number>
      Example#1: Given BLK_12 or BLK:12, the BLK address is 12
      Example#2: Given BLK_12_13 or BLK:12:13, the BLK addresses are 12 and 13
    PG or PAGE information: format is PAGE_<Number> or PG_<Number> or PAGE:<Number> or PG:<Number> for example, given PG_123, the PAGE or PG is 123
    PAGETYPE or PGTYPE information: LP, UP, XP, TP, SSLC, DSLC (Note that, if the pagetype is LP, UP, XP, or TP, the product type could be QLC)
    WL information: format is WL_<Number> or WL:<Number> for example, given WL_10, the WL is 10
    SHMOO information
    PHYPAGE refers to the physical page. This is different from PAGE. If this field is not provided, PHYPAGE is equal to 13 LSB of Page address.
      Example: Given PG_12345, PHYPAGE will be <page address & 0x1fff> = 4153
    STEP information
      Example: Given STEP_123 or STEP:123, Step = 123
    DECK information: UD, LD, MD, corresponding to upper deck, lower deck, middle deck, respectively
    PLANE address information: plane address maybe given as P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, or P5 or combination. 
         If plane address is not provided, it can be calculated as the 3-LSB bits of block address.
         Example: Given BLK_12 or BLK:12, plane address will be P0
         If plane address is not provided and there are more than 1 BLKs, plane address will be the combination of the given BLKs.
         Example: Given BLK_12_13_14_15 or BLK:12:13:14:15, plane address will be P0P1P2P3
  
  We refer to this part of tname as tparam, test param, or test prameters

  A field delimiter may use colon ':' or underscore '_':
    Option 1: <FIELD NAME>_<VALUE>  Example:  PAGE_37, fieldname or tparam is page ad the value is 37
              Sample FDV OUTPUT line: FDV OUTPUT [D:\NAND\150S\FDV\STAGING\RMAGUAD/BASIC_ERASE_PROGRAM_PAGE_READ_EIMPRO/BASIC_PROGRAM_PAGE_READ_EIMPRO_QLC.FDV::READ_ECC_BLK_778_PG_37_PGTYPE_LP_WL_2_SB_1_BL_3,SSYNC=TRUE,TRC=,DUTTEMP=-999,TAC=5.725000,SPECOFFSET=0.125,TM=12,VCC=2.5,VCCQ=1.2,TEMP=25]: DUT1,PASS,18592,16,0.00086,16,0.00011,0.008,FAILCOUNT_ONLY,

    Option 2: <FIELD NAME>:<VALUE>  Example:  PAGE:49206, fieldname or tparam is page ad the value is 49206
              Sample FDV OUTPUT line: FDV OUTPUT [D:\NAND\150S\FDV\FEATURE/FBM/FBM.FDV::FBM_SSLC_READ_PAGE_MP_BLK:89_PG:49206_SSLC_LUN:0_SEQ_54,SSYNC=TRUE,TRC=,DUTTEMP=-999,TAC=5.718000,SPECOFFSET=0.118,TM=19,VCC=2.35,VCCQ=1.2,TEMP=25]: DUT2,PASS,18592,0,0,0,0,0.02,FAILCOUNT_ONLY, 

- The tname section may consists of some '_' delimited tokens while part of it may intentionally include '_'
  In most cases, the part that is common to some or all of FDV POLL or FDV OUTPUT will be the base tname if it's 
  found at the beginning of tname, if it's at the end we'll call it user-defined tname or test description.
  The part that may change value are usually '_' delimited tokens (commonly, are the ones enumerated in Note above)

  The actual base or root tname can be a description in the tname that prefixes the informations mantioned in the "Note" above.
  This may include terms pertaining to nand operations and timing parameters like program, erase, read, eimpro, tbers, tprog, tcbsy.

  We will refer to this part of tname as testname.

  The testname is that protion of tname that has commonality to other data points and would usually refer to 
  a nand operation (e.g., PROGRAM, READ, EIMPRO, ERASE, SUSPEND etc). Array parameters anre not usually part of 
  testname. Parameters like page, blk, pagetype, deck, wl or wordline, shmoo are not part of testname.

  The testname is usually at the beginning of tname before BLK or PAGE or PG or PAGETYPE or DECK or product type.

  For example, in the line below:
    FDV OUTPUT [D:\NAND\150S\FDV\STAGING\RMAGUAD/BASIC_ERASE_PROGRAM_PAGE_READ_EIMPRO/BASIC_PROGRAM_PAGE_READ_EIMPRO_QLC.FDV::EIMPRO_ECC_BLK_778_PG_44_PGTYPE_LP_WL_2_SB_8_BL_3,SSYNC=TRUE,TRC=,DUTTEMP=-999,TAC=5.725000,SPECOFFSET=0.125,TM=12,VCC=2.5,VCCQ=1.2,TEMP=25]: DUT1,PASS,18592,29,0.0016,29,0.00019,0.008,FAILCOUNT_ONLY,

    tname is EIMPRO_ECC_BLK_778_PG_44_PGTYPE_LP_WL_2_SB_8_BL_3
    testname is EIMPRO_ECC
    testname can be derived from tname after removing all information referring ot either BLK, PAGE, PG, PAGETYPE, DECK, WL, SB, PAGEMAP (e.g QLC, SLC)

 

- Additional useful information to briefly describe the tname can be suffixed after the informations mentioned in the "Note" above.

  We will refer to this part of tname as test description or tdesc

- to find the fuseid or FID for each unit or DUT:
  o if FDV test is NOT specified as MLUN, of explicitly tagged as SDP, refer to the snippet below that can found from the fdv raw file:
    The first FUSEID:<FID or fuseid> refers to DUT1 
    The second FUSEID:<FID or fuseid> refers to DUT2 
    and so on, if there are more than 2

    if FUSEID cannot be found, use the value DUT#_9999999_999_99_99.

- to find the proberev of each DUT, look for the tname == 'PR'. The last value at the end of that line will be the PR or proberev 
  for the corresponding DUT. In the example below, the PR is 13 in hex. Convert this to decimal when reporting the value.

  if proberev is not provided or found, use the value 'XX'

- Instructions to get testtime 
  Every fdv log file contains a time stamp of start time and end time of testing.
  Below is an example:

  Test Start Date (34_tb_set_utility_READ_OPERATIONS_NATIVE): 2025_08_20 Test Start Time: 2:43:29
  <FDV OUTPUT or FDV POLL logs>
  Test End Date (34_tb_set_utility_READ_OPERATIONS_NATIVE): 2025_08_20 Test End Time: 2:47:50

  In the example above for test start date: 
    the date is 2025_08_20 (year, month, day)
    the time is 2:47:50    (24-hour, mins, sec)

  The testtime will be the difference between test end time and test start time in secs. Consider the date in the calculation.

  The testtime will be associated to the fdvlist and the fdvtests encapsulated by the start and end time.
